# Yosbel's Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio. A meticulously crafted webpage that not only tells my professional story but also demonstrates my capabilities as a frontend developer. This portfolio is built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React, showcasing a harmonious blend of modern web technologies and design principles.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Elements**: Powered by JavaScript and React, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience with interactive elements and live content updates.
- **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: Built as an SPA with React Router for seamless navigation without refreshing the page, enhancing the user experience with quick and efficient content delivery.
- **Performance Optimized**: Code-splitting and lazy loading implemented to ensure a fast loading time and an efficient, high-performance website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and semantic markup.
- **CSS3**: For responsive design and styling, including advanced animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic client-side scripting.
